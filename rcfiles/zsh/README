This file describes the current state of my zsh start-up scripts.

First, I move aside all the distribution's system-wide start-up
scripts.  On Fedora 17, this meant:

sudo mv /etc/zsh /etc/zsh-dist

Here is the order of execution for zsh startup scripts:
  .zshenv - always, unless -f is specified
  .zprofile - only for login shells
  .zshrc - only for interactive shells
  .zlogin - only for login shells.

~/.zshenv is small.  It sets umask, defines a function "desire" which
sources the specified script if it exists and then finds an
appropriate value for ZDOTDIRS, searching the following sequence until
it finds a directory:
  $HOME/zsh/$OSTYPE/$(uname -n)
  $HOME/zsh/$OSTYPE
  $HOME/zsh

If none of those directories exists, .zshenv unsets ZDOTDIR so zsh can
use the basic configuration files in $HOME.

In the system-specific directory, "$HOME/zsh/$OSTYPE/$(uname -n)",
here's what happens in the zsh startup files:

.zshenv - set up a standard environment for all shells:
  function_definitions
  cygwin_build_environment
  build_environment
  set_path
  language_definitions

.zshrc - set up a user environment for interactive shells:
  environment_variables
  shell_behaviors
  key_bindings
  shell_aliases
  set_rcmap
  cygwin_additions
  completion_definitions
